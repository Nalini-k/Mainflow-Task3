Developed a secure login and signup system using PHP and MySQL. Created a database with user authentication, including username, email, and password fields. Implemented frontend forms with HTML/CSS, ensuring responsive design and validation. The backend uses PHP for input validation, password hashing, and SQL injection prevention through prepared statements. After successful login, users are redirected to a protected dashboard.
